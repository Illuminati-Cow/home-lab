To pass-through a PCI device (non-gpu) (GRUB)
1. Find slot id number using > lshw grep NAME -A 10 or > lspci -vmmnnk | grep NAME -A 10
2. Use slot id to find sys path using >  find /sys/devices/pci* | grep SLOTID
3. Take sys device path and then add it to a shell script called bind_vfio.sh
	- Script should be in the format
	#SOF
	echo "vfio-pci" SYSDEVICEPATH/driver_override
	// However many pci devices that need to be passed through
	modprobe -i vfio-pci
	#EOF
	- located at /etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/bind_vfio.sh
4. Ensure that you have blacklisted the device if neccesary in kernel cmd line
	and have set up iommu correctly.
